## Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning and customer behavior data.  
After performing **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and training classification models, the results show that churn is strongly influenced by factors such as **MonthlyCharges**, **tenure**, **TotalCharges**, and **Contract type**.  

Among the models tested, **Random Forest** performed better than **Logistic Regression** due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.  

### Key Takeaways
- Churn is highly impacted by pricing and customer tenure  
- Long-term contracts help reduce churn  
- Early customer retention strategies can improve customer lifetime value (CLV)
