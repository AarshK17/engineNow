## Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning and customer behavior data.  
After performing **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and training classification models, the results show that churn is strongly influenced by factors such as **MonthlyCharges**, **tenure**, **TotalCharges**, and **Contract type**.  

Among the models tested, **Random Forest** performed better than **Logistic Regression** due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.  

### Key Takeaways
- Churn is highly impacted by pricing and customer tenure  
- Long-term contracts help reduce churn  
- Early customer retention strategies can improve customer lifetime value (CLV)

## Project 2: Sales Forecasting & Demand Prediction  

This project focuses on forecasting future sales using historical retail transaction data and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard.  

The goal was to build an **end-to-end time series forecasting solution** integrating **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, **forecast modeling**, and **business visualization**.
A **Prophet time-series forecasting model** was implemented to predict future demand, as it effectively captures trend and seasonal behavior in retail sales. Model performance was evaluated using **MAE** and **RMSE** metrics to validate forecast accuracy.

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to visualize historical sales trends, category-wise performance, shopping mall insights, and forecasted demand to support business decision-making.

### Key Takeaways
- Sales exhibit clear seasonal patterns at a monthly level  
- Certain product categories and shopping malls consistently outperform others  
- Time-series forecasting can support inventory planning and demand management  
- Visual dashboards enable faster and more effective business insights  

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Prophet (Time Series Forecasting)  
- Scikit-learn (Evaluation Metrics)  
- Power BI  
- Jupyter Notebook
