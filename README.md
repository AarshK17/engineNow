### - 1. Project_1 : This project focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning and customer behavior data. After performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training classification models, the results showed that churn is strongly influenced by factors such as MonthlyCharges, tenure, TotalCharges, and Contract type. Among the models tested, Random Forest provided better performance compared to Logistic Regression due to its ability to capture complex patterns. Based on the insights, strategies like improving early customer retention, optimizing pricing plans, and encouraging long-term contracts can significantly help reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.
